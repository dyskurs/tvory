But who marches there, but who marches there  
In such an enormous horde of despair?  
 — Byelorussians.

But what do they bear on their scraggy backs,  
With bleeding hands, and with feet shod in bast?  
 —  Their injustice.

But where do they bear their injustice to,  
But where do they bear it in open view?  
 — To all people.

But what, then, taught these, many million strong,  
To rouse up from sleep, and bear forth their wrong?  
 — Need and sorrow.

But what then, but what had these paupers in mind,  
Suppressed through the centuries, deaf and blind?  
 —  To be called humans.
