**A LAPWING IS CRYING**

A lapwing's crying in dewy teas.

¬´Give me dew to drink, please, give.. ¬ª My heart s tom with sorrow, it bleeds. Should I live? Or should not I five?

This land, this land I liked!

This land, this land I like!

I feet very confused and tired When looking at it, but why?

Over it there is a dark haze, And over it a black kite flies... My soul may haven't been burnt ‚Äî The kite's looking for it with eyes.

Oh, lapwing, why can't you stop crying? Why don't you drink dew in morn leas? It's dark like at night ail around...

Should you construct your nest on these trees?..

But, oh, indeed, why ought we to die, 0 Motherland, my dear side?

The kite always hangs in the sky, And it always takes its sharp sight...

The Sozh laps at my feet, it's not quiet.

It was blue, every blue, but turned black... My neighbour will sharpen his knife, He'll plunge it, he'll never come back...

But there is no one, no one

To prevent him from doing so.

Winter wanders ‚Äî it's not very far, Covers fields and rivers with snow...

But till then you may cry, you may cry, Cry, oh, lapwing...

What else should I want?

Neither happiness nor luck are mine, And I can't change my heavy lot...

A lapwing's crying in dewy leas...

Following the twilight In the  dark heavens

High...

Over the whitish fog It  was crying anxiously. And  at night  its crying Became weak and melted. Was it wounded? Maybe The birg was calling to me. I watched the crane flying, Butlcouldnot  help  it...

Sailed ‚Äî  it was big. It was bright ‚Äî Lighting up evening fields, Lighting up the road.

And this autumn grey bird Vanished in the twilight, Vanished forever over The water ‚Äî meadow.
