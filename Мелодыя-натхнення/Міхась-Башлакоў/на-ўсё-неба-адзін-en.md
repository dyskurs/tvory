**ALONE IN  THE HEAVENS**

O'er the river the moon Was rising in the grey dusk Above the hayfield the fog Drifted drowsily.

An old black boat

Lay getting cold in grass.

The day was tired of work ‚Äî It was leaving slowly...

The dark night was ready To come to the meadow. But suddenly harsh crying Was heard in the sky: O'er Polesie a crane Was flying wailing alone,
