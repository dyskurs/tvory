Somewhere on the river Nile's green delta Storks are gathering fortheir homeward flight. Maybe there they find no food nor shelter, Maybe there the living space is tight?

Clearly not.

Butin warm lands far distant,

One thing's lacking for their feathered guests ‚Äî Those tall oaks, on Nieman's shores existent, Where they really need to build their nests.
