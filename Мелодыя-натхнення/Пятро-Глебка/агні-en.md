**LIGHTS**

Our block is enormous to measure —

Four hundred flats or more here, Were live a well-known professor,

A doctor, a fine engineer,

A fitter, a marvelous turner,

A poet, an actor of fame,

And a young unmarried joiner —

My neighbour — who's earned a good name.

Here live industrious people;

And during the working day, Breathing deep to itself, and peaceful, Silence stands in the bay.

stands, and from windows watches e bustling life in the court, sunshine the playground catches, еге  kiddies' mock battles are fought.

Там часта сярод зеляніны Ля шумнай чародкі дзяцей Спыняецца моўчкі жанчына I доўга не зводзіць вачэй,

А ўвечар, калі загамоніць, Увесь велізарнейшы дом, — Ружовым, зялёным, чырвоным, Блакітным і сінім агнём

Ад самага верху дадолу Гарыцьён... I толькі адно

He свеціцца бляскам вясёлым На трэцім паверсе акно.

I часам прыезджы каторы Пытае: — А хто там жыве? — Жыве мацярынскае гора, Жыве не вясну і не дзве.

Жыве з таго часу, з якога Да маці прыйшлі не сыны, А грозна прыйшла да парога Жахлівая вестка з вайны.

Будынкі суседнія з ласкай 3 той даты ці можа спакон Галубяць акно гэта бляскам Усіх сваіх тысяч акон.

Яны, не згасаючы, свецяць, Каб гэтае ў горы акно

Заўсёды на ўсім белым свеце Было ўсім народам відно.

often, among the greenery, Hear the flocks of children at play, A  woman stands serenely, And  can't tear  her  eyes away.

But  when all's a-buzz in the evening, Our gigantic block's all bright With pink and red and greenish, pale blue and yellow light.

From the topmost floor to the basement It shines... But one place is poor — There is no bright light in one casement, A window upon the third floor.

And sometimes a newcomer queries: «But  tell me — who lives there?»

There lives a mother, still grieving. There lives no spring, no pair.

She lives so since that moment Of terrible news from the war, Which she heard in dread and torment — That her son will return no more.

In  the near by blocks the neighbours Since then, on endless nights, That window caress with radiance From all their thousand lights

And steadily they are shining, So that spot where grief is still green, In the whole wide world undying Should by all the people be seen.
