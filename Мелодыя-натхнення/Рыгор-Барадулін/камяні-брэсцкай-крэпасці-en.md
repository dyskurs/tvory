**THE STONES OF BREST FORTRESS**

Like nervous veins we pulse

Upon the earth's temple.

We were once the living walls Of  a fort impregnable.

This is our wrath made known, Turned to stone.

This is we who were burned in the fire,

We ‚Äîthe blood-soaked bricks and mire, for  you, only peace was our desire, Good people...

_Translated by Walter May__._
