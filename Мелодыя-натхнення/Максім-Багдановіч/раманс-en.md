**ROMANCE**

_Quand_ _l__uira cette_ _et__o__ile_ _u__n_ _jour__,_ _La p__lus_  _b__e__ll__e et l__a_  _plu__s lointaine, Dites-__l__ui qu'elle eut m__on_ _a__m__o__u__r_ _0_ _derniers d__e_  _la_  _r__a__c__e humaine_ _S__u__lly-P__rud__h__omme__._

Venus has risen above the broad skyline, Brought in her wake shining memories of love, Do you recall, when we met for the first time Venus had risen above?

From that time forth, evermore I'd go gazing Upon the night sky, seeking long for that star, Within me a deep silent love for you blazing From that time forth, evermore.

But the time of our parting draws near, ever nearer, Thus does our fate, does our fortune appear;

Deeply, profoundly I loved you, my dear one, But the time of our parting draws near.

In that far country, my buried under

My heart, dull and dreary, each night, high above, I shall gaze on that planet, my heart filled with wonder, In that far country, my love.

Gaze upon Venus once more, when far distant One from another, there mingling we'll pour Our glance ‚Äî let love flower if but for an instant, Gaze upon Venus once more.

_Translated by Vera Rich._
