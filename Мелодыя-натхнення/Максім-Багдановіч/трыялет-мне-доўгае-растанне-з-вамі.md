**RONDEAU**

Design of stars so fair and fine In the dark firmament is blazing; Waters of pools and marshes shine Mirroring in their depths this blazon. A mist into far space doth twine, A choir of frogs chants hymns of praising The beauty in the puddles shrined. And in them burns a fair, amazing Design.

Frogs curse the sun that hides from gazing The puddles'stars by day.  The pine Woods hear, the field hears the croaked phrasing; But frog-songs o'er the mountain spine Rise not, where once some hand was tracing Design.

_Translated by Vera Rich._
