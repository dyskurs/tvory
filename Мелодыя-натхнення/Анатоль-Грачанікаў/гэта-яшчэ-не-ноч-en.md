it **IS STILL  NOT  YET  NIGHT**

It  is still not  yet night

just look how the fish are leaping: There's a silvery rain on the stream. The  tug in the bay bellows steam, Like a bull that's removed from the herd. Over pastures there slumbers a haze.

It was such a dry, sultry day.

And now is beginning

Dame Nature's nocturnal feast:

The earth and the sky are merging.

The grasses rise. And the stars. And high thoughts.

And dreams come alive.

The forest appears a black wall, And the moon is a tower.

One wishes to take a look At  the day to come.

Let us wash our tiredness away In the spring-fresh Sozha,

And sit on the water-logged oak Which rises out of its depths, And say not a word.
