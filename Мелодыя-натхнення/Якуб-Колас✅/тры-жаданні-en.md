Land and bread we are seeking,  
Hard is a beggar's task,  
Heaven grants not our needing,  
No words for more to ask.

Sun and light we are seeking,  
Hard 'tis to stumble blind,  
Hard to live without greeting,  
Like some accursed-kind.

We seek life, freedom cherished,  
Hard 'tis the yoke to bear —  
And it will never perish,  
Perish away nowhere.
