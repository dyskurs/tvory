Could I live without you?

And  did not  know

That somewhere on earth's vast expands Beyond the deafforests,

Beyond hundreds of hills, baulks of grass, In no  far constellation But hereon our planet, In  a green quiet alley Your  life  you passed.

Could I live without you?

And maybe we might have met never, Haifa year apart

We might have passed by, And diverged as the paths In the fields diverge ever, And would not have known Whose the blame was, nor why.

Maybe it was needed To  fall into hell first, To lose near ones, know anguish, Suffer frost, suffer heat, That fierce storms might not fell us, That  with  you Beneath the Pole Star 1 might meet.

Recognize you,

And at once forget all that has wronged me, To see beams of light sparkle ,n  your pupils again, To be born anew,

And believe there'll come strongly, Succour and happiness, °nefor us twain.

Назаўсёды скарыцца Непадкупнай

Суровай тваёй чысціні, Каб істоты тваёй адкрываць Таямніцы,

Каб душу гартаваць на высокім агні.

Час ляціць і ляціць,

Завіруха завеяла скроні, Пакідаюць насечкі Гады на ілбе.

Я гляджу на цябе, Я дзіўлюся і сёння, Чым я жыў без цябе, Як я жыў без цябе?..

т0  grow

w surrender for  ever

_T__o your u__n__bribable_ purity, steadfast and stern. _f__o__e_ mystery of your nature

_To discover,_

To temper the soul in a flame high, eterne.

Time  is flying, is flying. And a snowstorm drifts the brows over, And the years on the forehead Have scored through and through. And I look upon you. Still, today wondering ever, How I lived without you When I lived without you.
