**ШЧАСЦЕ**

Простае шчасце людское, Так як і наша з табою,

Пэўна, складаецца з солі,

3 хлеба, сабранага ў полі,

3 поту, дарожнага пылу,

3 роднага небасхілу,

3 дружбы, мацнейшай ад смерці,

3 песні... Iтакмне здаецца:

Каб з чаго іншага скласці, Дык ці было б яно шчасцем.

You with your dear one, warmed by loving, Never  would part till the dawn was coming, In  you would flourish a mother's power, You with your child in the sun would flower... Oh, how such breasts would suckle its tears! Ave Maria!

Maybe the mortal prayer I prattle Might be of aid to me in mty battle. But alas! — they are calling and crying...

She has gone after them, deeply sighing, Down the dark vaults to disappear...

Ave Maria!

_Translated by Walter May__._
