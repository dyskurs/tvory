**THE  OAK  LEAF**

In August beauty stand the oaks in view, The paths are strewn with straw and barley stubble. An oak leaf marked with veins and dashed with dew, Reminds me of the shape of Byelorussia.

And here it lies upon my open hand, And seems to me like some fine sheet of armour. The veins of every oak leaf in the land With every vein upon my hand welds firmer.

_Translated by Walter May__._
