Rise, my lads, arise, my brothers!

Rise, you too, beloved land!

In our huts the spring breeze flutters, See, a bright new life's at hand.

Have our arms, my lads, grown weakened? Has God given us no strong hearts?

Has no light of freedom beaconed Over our dear native parts?

Let us work in massive numbers, Stand together, like a wall, And, reviving from its slumbers, Our dear country with us all!
