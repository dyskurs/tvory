Until it's late —

get all the windows open, Have in the birdsong to the toppest note, The autumn evening that is wet and sopping, The breath of wind, so lenient and soft.

Until it's late —

get all the windows open, Salute the first ray of the morning sun, The first racemes of the vermillion rowans, And red-ripe garden's sultriness, and such.

Until it's late —

get all the windows open...
