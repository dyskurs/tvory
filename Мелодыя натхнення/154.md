 
Seek me out, send me the call!

Then we'll wander in the grasses. True, with love commences all — All which for reality passes.

Only be sincere in soul

On life's road of shine and shadows.

True, with love commences all —

Our first step and our first gladness.

Spring begins with the nightingale, With the freshet's murmuration.

True, with love commences all — Pain, and hate, and separation.

Seek me out, send me the call!
