**0  SPRING...**

0  spring, O long- Awaited one!

You will return, Come back again!

The joyful singing, Welcoming, Of water-brooks Be heard again,

The grove will waken, And with song In green leaf clothe Itself again,

The woods resound With whistling birds, The meadow wear New grass again,

And from the south With levin-light The stormcloud press Its way again.

And the first thunder, Music-like, Mysterious Roll forth again,

And all the earth Will snake again, With rain will wash Itself again,

Ды толькі мне He вернешся, He вернешся Ты, моладасць.

Вясна, вясна Жаданая!

Ты вернешся,  
Ты вернешся!
