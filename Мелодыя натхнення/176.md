 
**WANDERING**

Oh, these rains, these rains —

Of  grey  days tears —

They knock against frames, They  call up dreams.

I'm walking lonely,

A crank, in  the dark,

Where only

Dogs are heard to bark.

Fair's not twinkling

Lighting up roads.

Only rain's drizzling

Against small stones.

What am I longing For? Where is it?

Oh, my wandering, Where do you lead?
