**A WINTER TALE**

A snowy night hangs, a savage night hangs, A grey pelt above forests'wild tresses.

In white plumage of snow, in a white silk of snow, Valleys, hills under rich snowy dresses.

In the wild of the woods, the age-slumbering woods, Dwell a people, ill-natured, unspeaking.

In a palace of glass, on a bed all of glass Lies a maiden with sun-bright hair, sleeping.

Go you, call her by name; go you, wake her again — Then all fir-trees will utter harsh creaking.

Then the tempest will moan, then the tempest will groan, White-eyed winter complain with loud speaking.

Winter then, in alarm, winter then, fearing harm, In a frenzy of frost will spin, swirling;

Like a horse without rein, like a grey-and-white flame, The blind snowstorm will rush, rearing, whirling.

And the maid will sigh deep, stir in heavy-dreamed sleep, With her fingers brush brows clear of hoar-frost, She will gaze all around, unrestrained, all around, Sad the grey wolves will howl in the forest.

Go you, rouse her again — and the spring comes again, Over ploughland larks revel unstinting,

On the river, ice cracks, and away the floes break, And the playful floods wash out the winter.

_Translated by Vera Rich._
