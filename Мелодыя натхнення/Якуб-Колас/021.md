O spring, O long-  
Awaited one!  
You will return,  
Come back again!

The joyful singing,  
Welcoming,  
Of water-brooks  
Be heard again,

The grove will waken,  
And with song  
In green leaf clothe  
Itself again,

The woods resound  
With whistling birds,  
The meadow wear  
New grass again,

And from the south  
With levin-light  
The stormcloud press  
Its way again.

And the first thunder,  
Music-like,  
Mysterious  
Roll forth again,

And all the earth  
Will snake again,  
With rain will wash  
Itself again,

In nature all  
Be born again,  
And youth to it  
Return again,

But thou wilt not  
Return again,  
Return again,  
To me, sweet youth!

O spring, O long-  
Awaited one,  
You will return,  
Return again!
