Do not beg, and don't expect  
Cheerful ballads from my lyre,  
For, when I strike up my song,  
Sorrow burns more fierce than fire.

I would laugh and joke with you,  
And for you some fun would make,  
But I look on life around,  
And my heart begins to ache.

How unhappy is our lot:  
We were given not a thing.  
Do not seek the meadow flower,  
For to us there came no spring.
