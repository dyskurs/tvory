**AS  IN SUMMER**

**A** haystack by the house.

A grazing light bay horse.

Behind flower gardens

The bright rowan's fire burns.

In our old garden

Late autumn apples shine.

And though the fall has started,

The days are warm and bright.

Loneliness and dumpiness

Can smell in such a way...

In marshes at dense darkness

My crane cries every day...

_Translated by Tatyana Akushevich._
