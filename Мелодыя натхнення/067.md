**AUTUMN SONG**

Let us go, dearest, together.

In the forest so thick,

Silent, because it has now finished reigning,

Yellow and naked it grows, with grass waning,

The bushes grow black.

Let us go, love, 'neath the oak-tree

We shall sit down, my dear.

There we shall watch the leaves tumbling and falling,

We shall hear their sad rustle, the soft murmured calling Of the stream ringing clear.

We'll be alone in the world there,

Alone there, we two,

Who come at the time of its agonized passing,

To bid the poor forest a sad farewell, lasting

Till the spring comes anew.
