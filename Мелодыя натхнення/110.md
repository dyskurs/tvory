 
**HAPPINESS**

Human happiness, one with another,

As simple as ours together,

Consists of the salt of service,

Of bread brought in at the harvest,

Of sweat, of road's dusty herdship,

Of loyal and deathless friendship,

Of  our native land's horizon,

Of  our songs... And thus I reason:

If one part were changed, one token, Would not happiness be broken?
