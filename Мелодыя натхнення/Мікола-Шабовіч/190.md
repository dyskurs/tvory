**HEARTQUAKE**

Occurrence!

Emergency!

Accident!

At N-th Street at midnight fleeting

The heartquake has happened, it's evident:

The concurrence of something, The destruction of something completely... ‚Äî

All the morning reporters're flying.

There was nothing more radio-relevant. That was just an intrusion of love The Real one.
