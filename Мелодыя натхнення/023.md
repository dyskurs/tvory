 
**THREE WISHES**

Land and bread we are seeking, Hard is a beggar's task, Heaven grants not our needing, No words for more to ask.

Sun and light we are seeking, Hard 'tis to stumble blind, Hard to live without greeting, Like some accursed-kind.

We seek life, freedom cherished, Hard 'tis the yoke to bear — And it will never perish, Perish away nowhere.

_Translated by Vera Rich._
