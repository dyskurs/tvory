**THE  GIRL  AND  THE SMITH**

Once ripe rye was being reaped By a girl — eighteen or so — Suddenly the combine ceased — What a blow — a blow!

Fine — quite near the smithy lies: «Smith, my lad, I need your aid!» Hands start work, but big brown eyes Steal towards the maid...

Soon September stole away. And November. Winter came. He remembered her each day, Waited her again

Suddenly a ringing cry

Echoed as merrily as before: «Smith, I need your aid, dear boy, Help me out once more.

I was hurrying home so fast — Now, just look, my sledge won't go. See, the runner broke in half.

What a blow — a blow!»

'Neath his strong and skilful hands Bends the beaten willing steel.

With a timid smile he stands, Murmurs to the girl:

Li Jbi!  !ФВШ|!|(|’

* He забудзь, дзяўчына-краска, Гэту сцежку к кавалю,
    

«I*

Калі трэба, калі ласка, Ўсё скую, усё зраблю.

* А скаваць ты шчасце можаш? Будзеш лепшым кавалём.
    
* Што ж, калі  ты дапаможаш, To як след яго скуём.
