 
**0 BIELARUS, MY BRIAR-ROSE CHERISHED...**

0 Bielarus, my briar-rose cherished,

0 leaf of green, O flower of red, In the wild wind you shall not perish, Nor choke, by rank weeds overspread.

For I, myself, shall be your petals, HI pierce my heart upon the pikes Of your dear eyes, the hue of metal, The rays I love, burnished and bright.

Never shall the wild-blowing breezes Unloose your maiden plaits so fair, Through the world's striving, you strive ceaseless. That joy may blossom everywhere.

Foes shall not cause your path to perish, In hardship is the spirit bred, 0 Bielarus, my briar-rose cherished, 0 leaf of green, O flower of red.
