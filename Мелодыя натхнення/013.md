 
**DO NOT BEG, AND DON'T EXPECT**

Do not beg, and don't expect Cheerful ballads from my lyre, For, when I strike up my song, Sorrow burns more fierce than fire.

I would laugh and joke with you, And for you some fun would make, But I look on life around, And my heart begins to ache.

How unhappy is our lot:

We were given not a thing.

Do not seek the meadow flower, For to us there came no spring.

_Translated by Walter May__._
