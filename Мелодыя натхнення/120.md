**ACHING HEART**

True happiness will not come without good reason, And lacking courage a warrior soon will yield, And lacking sorrow wrinkles are out of season, And lacking faith no wound will soon be healed.

Our hearts don't start to ache without a worry, And lacking goodness you don't go at night Upon a steep and unknown road and hurry, Soto relieve your fellow's grievous plight.

But when you've suffered all, and in full measure, And never spared yourself for other's sake, Then do not fear an occasional twinge or seizure, For  you were given a heart it should ache.

_Translated by Walter May._
