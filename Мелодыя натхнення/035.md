 
I should like to meet with you on the highway In the quiet blue of the night And to say:

'Do you see there those brilliant stars, The bright constellation of Hercules? Towards them our sun is flying, And with the sun, follows the earth. What then are we?

Only wayfarers, voyaging together among the stars. Why then, here on earth,

Are there quarrels and feuding, pain and sorrow, When all together we fly To the stars?
