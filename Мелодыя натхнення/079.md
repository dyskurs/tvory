dawn  choir

The mists of dawn are still arising,

The first light wavers like a thread, But how the dawn choir is rejoicing, Enough to waken up the dead!

The nightingale's sweet song first trembles,

The starling's tenor firmly rings;

Some stoutly thunder on the cymbals, Some pass the bow across the strings.

And then is heard «cuckoo-cuckoo»

In tender tones, as on the flute;

While woodpeckers drum a sharp tattoo, With «chuck-chuck-chuck» keep time to suit.

The unseen skylark greets the morrow, Pours out its heart in heavens high.

The cheeky, worldly, courtyard sparrow Chirps up and says: «And here am I!»

This choir for me is dear and glorious, I feel my heart sings with them too.

I rise and greet you, happy chorus, I rise and greet the sun with you.

_Translated by Walter May__._
