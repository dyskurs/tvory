irretrievable

Oh, the last Polesian ferry, Let me across the Pripyat to ferry. Creak in autumn, cold and rainy, In parting in misty morning. Carry, Creak in autumn, cold and rainy, Oh, my last Polesian ferry...

The Pripyat, buoys, horses, boats — They are the last and irretrievable... You and I on the ferry, both, You are mournful... But it's unforgivable... You and I on the ferry, both, The Pripyat, buoys, horses, boats...

Do you hear far clanging of cranes, Flying high over sad stubble fields?! On this last, but on the best of lands...

Let them, God, not be the last to flap wings On this last, but on the best of lands... Do you hear far clanging of cranes?!

In this life we lack poetic lines... But we do not keep the last poetry. As though in wet reed-beds wind cries, My poor soul cries desperately, As though in wet reed-beds wind cries, In this life we lack poetic lines...

Ah, the last Polesian ferry, In grey mist I'll hail, I'll call you, I'll wait In autumn time, cold and rainy.

Creak in parting, creak, my ferry, you may... In autumn time, cold and rainy, My last, my Polesian ferry...
