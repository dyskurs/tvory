**INTENT**

In  the forest under birches,

Hid from foes' inquisitive eye, In  no  hut, and in no trenches, Butin greenery tent I lie.

In  the earth seven stout poles driven — Round them twigs and reeds I wove.

Like  a burial-mound, moss-hidden, Stands my partisan abode.

Palm-sized table in the middle — Five  more poles as bed I keep, Spread with fragrant hay a little, So as softer there to sleep.

Everything in proper order:

Where I lie — I make my bed. Ifthere's rain, my tent 'gainst water I soon pitch above my head.

Time will leave no war-time traces:

Then on eager footsteps bent

Deep in the woods I'll seek old places — Find my partisan green tent.
