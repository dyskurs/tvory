**TRIOLET**

For me this long-drawn absence from you Is blacker far than your black braids. Why has this evil time then made For me this long-drawn absence from you? Grown white where bitter tear-drips strayed, A triolet thus I started on you: For me this long-drawn absence from you Is blacker far than your black braids.
