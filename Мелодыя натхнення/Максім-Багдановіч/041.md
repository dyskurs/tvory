**IN WINTER**

Heil, frosty evening, ringing, calling, Heil, crunching crisp, soft spread of snow, No snowstorm blows, the wind has fallen, And freely the light sledges go.

Like phantoms, birches whitely hover, Under night-time's dark-blue quilt, In the heavens, the stars shiver, Frozen utterly, frost-chilled.

The moist moon from on high is shedding A shaft, transparent and aglow, And with silver cloaks is spreading The blueing acres of the snow.

With sledges cleave the snow, good horses! Gay copper bells, ring out with zest! Forests and fields fly in swift courses, The blood is boiling in the breast.
