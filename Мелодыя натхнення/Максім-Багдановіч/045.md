**SONNET**

_Un sonnet sans defaut Vaut seul un long poeme. Boileau._

Where the Egyptian sands spread far around, Close where the waves of azure Nile are flowing, A tomb stood many thousand years: men going Within, some seeds hid in a jar were found.

Although the grains were parched and dried, still sound Their vital force awoke, and, new life knowing, Flourished abundantly, young ears were growing, In spring the crop stood high above the ground.

Forgotten land of mine, this is your symbol;

At last the people's spirit is atremble,

I believe it lies not in sterile sleep,

But that it will surge upward like a fountain, Which, rushing in a mighty, sounding leap, Pierces the soil, into free spaces mounting.

_Translated by Vera Rich._
