I thought that it was spring alone I loved:

In spring I soon mix up my true location.

In spring there sings within such aspiration —

I thought that it was spring alone I loved.

I thought that autumn I could not abide:

The autumn is so comfortless and dreary

With that which has not happened, lone and weary — I thought that autumn I could not abide.

Yes, parting struck upon the big blue bell:

How long already my imagination

Leads back to native parts, as if salvation —

Yes, parting struck upon the big blue bell...

Yet summer, winter, all I now accept —

The springtime floods, the leaves in autumn falling.

If earth, like sunshine is my spirit warming — Yet summer, winter, all I now can bless!
